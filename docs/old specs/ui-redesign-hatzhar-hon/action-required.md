Manual steps that must be completed by a human. These cannot be automated.

## Before Implementation

- [ ] **Provide logo file** - Upload logo image file for use in header and marketing pages (or confirm to use text-only logo initially)

## During Implementation

- [ ] **Review Hebrew copy** - Review and approve all Hebrew text content for marketing pages (hero, features, pricing)
- [ ] **Pricing decisions** - Confirm final pricing tiers and amounts for the pricing page
- [ ] **FAQ content** - Provide the actual FAQ questions and answers to display

## After Implementation

- [ ] **Content review** - Final review of all Hebrew text for grammar and tone
- [ ] **Design review** - Visual review of the implemented UI to ensure it matches expectations
